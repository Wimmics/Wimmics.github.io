The 3.2.0 version of Corese is now available on Central.

To use it as a library, it is now as simple as to add in your pom.xml 
the following lines:
{% highlight xml%}
        <dependency>
            <groupId>fr.inria.wimmics</groupId>
            <artifactId>kgengine</artifactId>
            <version>3.2.0</version>
        </dependency>
{% endhighlight %}
